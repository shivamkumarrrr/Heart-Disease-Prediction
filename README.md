# Heart Disease Prediction Analysis

This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook detailing a machine learning project focused on predicting heart disease. The project utilizes various data analysis and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and make predictions regarding the presence of heart disease in patients.

## Project Overview

The Jupyter notebook contains a step-by-step analysis, starting from data preprocessing to model selection and evaluation. The dataset used in this project includes a range of variables such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and other vital signs that are considered important indicators of heart health.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** The notebook begins with cleaning the dataset to handle missing values and normalize the data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Before diving into predictive modeling, the notebook explores the data through various visualizations and statistics to uncover insights and trends.
- **Feature Selection:** Techniques are applied to select the most significant features that contribute to heart disease.
- **Model Building:** Several machine learning models are trained and tested, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, among others.
- **Model Evaluation:** The models are evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine the most effective approach for prediction.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The notebook includes hyperparameter tuning to enhance the performance of the chosen model.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas and NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

## Usage

To explore the heart disease prediction analysis, clone the repository, and ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can run the Jupyter notebook to see the analysis process and try out the models with the dataset provided.
